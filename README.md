# Saudade
was once described as "the love that remains" after someone is gone. Saudade is the recollection of feelings, experiences, places, or events that once brought excitement, pleasure, well-being, which now triggers the senses and makes one live again. It can be described as an emptiness, like someone or something that should be there in a particular moment is missing, and the individual feels this absence. 
<br>
It brings sad and happy feelings altogether, sadness for missing and happiness for having experienced the feeling.
